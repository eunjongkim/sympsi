Symbolic Quantum Mechanics with Python and SymPy
------------------------------------------------

This Python package is an exerimental fork and extension of the [quantum](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/tree/master/sympy/physics/quantum) module in [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org). For a list of contributors to the SymPy quantum module, see [this page](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/commits/master/sympy/physics/quantum). New features developed for SymPsi will be contributed upstream to the SymPy quantum module when mature and tested.
